## Planet Memory

Welcome to Planet Memory! Choose a planet and play a memory game from that planet. Choose Earth, Mars or the Moon and match each card with its pair. Each card is reflective of the planet it belongs to. Hurry! Match each card before the timer runs out and watch your pairs being counted on the scoreboard. 

Planet Memory is a simple memory game targeted towards kids/people who like to play spock games. Plant Memory is a fully responsive Javascript game that allows the user to match a pair of cards, playing agaisnt the timer to win the game. 


## Features

The homepage of Planet Memory hosts the instructions and 3 links within a list to take the user to each game. It also has the title of the site "Planet Memory" in the header and a footer at the end of the page. 

### Header

<PICTURE OF Header>
The header contains the title of my site and a icon to reflect the theme of the game. I also placed a favicon icon in the url for a more aesthically pleasing user experience. I choose the font Roboto as I felt it reflected the theme of the game the best. The title is easy to see for the user upon viewing the page.  

### Instructions 

<PICTURE OF INSTRUCTION BOX>
I placed the instructions in a div called aside and styled it accordingly to the websites pallet. I added a font awesome icon for aesthetic purposes. The instructions are clear, concise and the first thing the user is drawn to.  

### Navigation

<PICTURE OF Navigation>
I placed the navigation to each game in a list and gave each an icon to reflect which planet it was. I followed the websites pallet again and spread out the list evenly. When the user hovers over each planet block it changes color. I thought this was a nice feature for aesthetic purposes. 

### Footer

The footer contains the title of my site and two icon to reflect the theme of the game. I wrote sponsored by NASA as I used NASA's logo coloring to decide on the pallet of my website. 

## Game Area

### Earth Game

<PICTURE OF Earth Game>
If the user selects Earth they are taken to the page that hosts the game. The game begins and the player must match the cards with their pair before the timer runs out. As they match their cards the correct answer board collects their matches. When all the cards are matched an alert is brought to the user to inform them they have won and if they wish to play again. If it is an incorrect match, an alert is brought to the user to inform them it is incorrect, try again. If a correct match is selected, an alert is brought to the user to inform them they have won a pair and the score board is updated. There is a back button on the page to take the user back to the home page if they so wish. If the timer runs out an alert is brought to the user that they have run out of time and if they want to play again. If they select ok the page refreshes and the game starts again.  

I chose images of the earth as my cards. I thought this would be user friendly as the user explores planet earth while trying to match the cards. I chose images of the sea, whales, mountains etc all to reflect our blue planet. 

### Mars Game

If the user selects Mars they are taken to the page that hosts the game. The game begins and the player must match the cards with their pair before the timer runs out. As they match their cards the correct answer board collects their matches. When all the cards are matched an alert is brought to the user to inform them they have won and if they wish to play again.

There is a back button on the page to take the user back to the home page if they so wish. If the timer runs out an alert is brought to the user that they have run out of time and if they want to play again. If they select ok the page refreshes and the game starts again. 

I chose images of Mars as my cards. I thought this would be user friendly as the user explores Mars while trying to match the cards. I chose images of the red planet, rover, an astronaut, galaxies and even a UFO (for fun) all to reflect the red planet. 

### Moon Game

If the user selects the Moon they are taken to the page that hosts the game. The game begins and the player must match the cards with their pair before the timer runs out. As they match their cards the correct answer board collects their matches. When all the cards are matched an alert is brought to the user to inform them they have won and if they wish to play again. If it is an incorrect match, an alert is brought to the user to inform them it is incorrect, try again. If a correct match is selected, an alert is brought to the user to inform them they have won a pair and the score board is updated.

If the timer runs out an alert is brought to the user that they have run out of time and if they want to play again. If they select ok the page refreshes and the game starts again. 

I chose images of the Moon as my cards. I thought this would be user friendly as the user explores the Moon while trying to match the cards. I chose images of the moon, the Moon setting from earth, the planting of the US flag, a rocket etc all to reflect the Moon. 

## Score Board & Timer

<PICTURE OF SCORE BOARD>
I positioned the score board with the timer to keep it neat. When the user gets a correct match the board updates. The timer counts back from 1 minute. Given the general simplicity of this memory game I thought one minute was enough time to try and solve the matches. The timer counts back once the game is opened. If there is no user interaction with the page the timer will keep reseting. If the timer gets to zero the game is over and the player will be asked if they want to play again. There is a back button on the page to take the user back to the home page if they so wish.


## Features Left to Implement

I would like to add levels to my game by giving the player less time to play the game- reducing the timer to 30 seconds and so forth. I would like to implement a leader board to increase the competitiveness of my game. I would like the user to be able to select a character before exploring each planet. I would to update the images to better quality images to reflect each planet more adequately. 

## Testing

I tested my site on all formats- mobile phones, tablets and desktops. I used developer tools to make sure my site works on all device sizes. I sent my deployed link to friends and family to double check that it worked adequately on all different types of screens. 

I ran my deployed site on Google Chrome, Safari, Interent Explore, Firefox and Opera to make sure all worked well. 

# Mobile Devices - iphone SE, iphone XR, iphone 10, iphone 12 Pro, Pixel 5, Samsung Galaxy S8+, Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, Galaxy Fold

On Mobile Devices I decided to set each section to 100% width so it would fill the screen of the phone. I thought this made for a good user experience and made everything clearer to read. On Mobile devices that were less than 376px I decided to hide the footer I found it looked over crowded and made for a better user experience without it. 

On Mobile Screens larger than 414px I reintroduced the footer but made the font size 6px so that it wouldnt take up too much space. I placed the back button near the game to make it easy for the user to return to the home page if they desired to. 

# Tablet Devices - iPad Air, iPad Mini, Surface Pro 7, Surface Duo, Samsung Galazy A51/71, Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max

On tablet devices I expanded the content over the width of the screen as well using media queries. Similar to the mobile devices I placed the game under the timer and correct answer board and placed the back butoon near the game for easy user experience. The footer is also present here as there is more room for it. 

With the Surface Duo in particular I decided to treat it more like a mobile phone device as the screen size is small for a tablet (540px) so I pushed the game near the top of the screen and placed the back button beside the game for easy user experience. 

# Desktop Devices - Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max

For Nest Hub I spread the content across the width of the screen. Placing the game directly under the timer and correct answer board. I placed the button to the left of the screen for easy user experience. 

For Nest Hub Max I took a different approach and spaced the content of my game different. I did not strech the instruction box on the index page as personally I thought it looked too streched and took up too much space. I also made the navigation to each game smaller. For the gaming section I pushed the correct answer box and timer to the left of the screen and placed the game beside it with the back button just underneath it. I did think that there is a lot of space on the screen that isnt filled but I prefered this look than trying to spread everything out as when I made the game bigger the images became distorted.

## Unfixed Bugs

I was unable to fix the bug in the timer. The alert pops up when the timer is at 0:01 instead of 0:00. I have programmed an if statement to alert when its 0:00 but for some reasom it alerts at 0:01 and then when the user clicks 'ok' it changes to 0:00 and restarts the clock. 

I attempted to change to -1 but because I am preventing the timer going into the negative this did not work. I attempted to make another if statement with the condition (time = time < 0 ? 0 : time;) so the alert would come up at exactly 0:00 but I couldn't manage to get this to work before the deadline. 

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
